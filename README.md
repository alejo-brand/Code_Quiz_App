# Code_Quiz_App

In this app the user will be able to test their knowledge about classic videogames.
they will be able to do so by clicking the button that contains the right answer.
Every time they get a right answer the next question will be displayed and they will be notified with the word correct!
if the user gets a wrong answer, 20 seconds will be sustracted of the time and the word wrong! will also be promted.

## How the Code works
This code is written in vainilla JavaScript and we start by selecting all the elements required from the DOM and storing them in variables in the global scope so that we can acces them when needed.

The code for this app is based on several functions that perform a specific task within the code. (you will be able to see this in the comments written at the beginning of each function, explaining what they specifically do).

Local Storage is also being used in this app in order to allow the user to Save their initials and obtain their scores without loosing track of it, if the browser it's refreshed. The user is also provided with a button to clear their score and another button to start the game again.
